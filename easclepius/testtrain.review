Having been someone who has consistently battled chronic depression (and having been on every type of anti-depression medication while trying "techniques" in depression books) I can tell you that following the strategies in The Magic will help you overcome any anxiety, depression, sadness, or loss of hope that you may have in your life.I'm a pretty successful person on a financial level.  I've always done really well in business and in investing.However, I've always suffered on a personal level with family/friends and with battling depression.  In fact, not only have I not been successful in those arenas but I can honestly say that I've been a dismal failure.I've tried "overcoming depression" books and I've run the gamut with anti-depression medications.  Those remedies just mask the problem.  They don't actually overcome it.While reading The Magic and slowly (and quite easily...almost effortlessly) began implementing the very basic and easy-to-understand strategies presented, I INSTANTLY began to feel better...about everything.  Mind you, beforehand I had found myself slipping deeper and deeper into a "gloomy" state of mind, thinking perhaps I was going into a midlife crisis (at the age of 38...go figure) wondering...is this it?  Because if it is, this really blows!I didn't pick up this book to "change my life" or anything like that.  I really didn't know why I got this book except that maybe I was intrigued by the description and the other reviews of this book.  I read the book with an open mind, beginning to follow the exercises immediately upon reading the first chapter.I instantly began to feel uplifted.  I felt hope and a desire to do things in my life that I've long forgotten about or chalked off as a "waste of time" to bother with.Within just a few days of feeling this uplifted "church-like" feeling, I realized that it was my own weighty, heavy thoughts I was throwing needlessly upon myself that was pushing me down into a depression.  Now, don't get the wrong idea.  This isn't some "positive thinking" clap-trap type of self-help book.  This goes BEYOND positive thinking because I didn't have to force myself to say, "Don't think that negative thought, Monica, focus on what you can be grateful for."  Instead, I automatically pushed away the negative thoughts that were bringing me down immediately as they entered my mind in an automatic "I-don't-have-time-for-this" type of fashion.And this is way different than how I have been thinking my entire life!After a week of going through the exercises, I found myself bouncing out of bed and having this exciting feeling in the pit of my stomach that I didn't remember having in a long time.  It's that exciting feeling that I remember having when I was a kid, maybe right before Christmas or going to an exciting place.And I feel this way all the time now!  How amazing and awesome is that?!So, I can't say that I've experienced "miracles" in the physical world such as a pile of money coming my way or winning the lottery because it didn't happen that way.  Instead, I got a much greater gift out of the deal!  I truly got The Magic back in my life...child-like magic that I've long forgotten about.  And it's back making me excited about life, energetic, and giving me my "groove" back.One thing I do have to say on the "business" side of this is that because I've gotten this Magic in my life, I have found that my businesses are "taking care of themselves" since I've lost the daily stress and anxiety I've had over every detail of both my businesses.  And because I now have a renewed interest in "life" while being excited about going to the office everyday, I have been blessed with new creative ideas for marketing, products, and managing my operations that I would have never dreamed of getting before (since I was sunk so low in a cesspool of depression).  One business that I wanted to drop is automatically dropping away while the other I have a stronger interest in is really starting to take off.  This is something I've been trying to forcefully line up for years and it's now taking care of itself automatically now that I have "let go" of the process.If you're a business person and you feel trapped, get this book.  If you want to make any major life change but don't know how and need guidance, get this book.  If you are battling depression and pills, books, and shrinks aren't helping, get this book.I should mention too that I didn't do all the exercises in The Magic as Rhonda Byrnes mentions.  I don't care for sitting in a corner writing out my thoughts in a journal.  I type 85 WPM and my handwriting is slow (and sucks) plus I don't have the time to commit to that part of the process so I don't do that part of the exercises as she suggests.  As long as I "feel" the gratitude deeply, genuinely, and joyfully as she addresses in her books, The Magic is working.I can see how using this book with the book Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting: The Astonishing Power of Feelings can truly change your life on both spiritual and financial levels at the same time since they both talk about feeling those "feelings" at the pit of your stomach to start changing the universal energy around you (and thus changing your life in the directions you want to go).Great stuff!  Highly recommended!

I have to say from the outset that I am a big fan of Rhonda Byrne's work; but I'm a fan of it because her books and film have literally transformed my life.  Although I was always a naturally happy and optimistic person, now I would describe myself as a joyful person (most of the time!  We can't and are not meant to always be joyful).  The joy comes from knowing that absolutely nothing is impossible for me and my life, from knowing the power of goodness and love, from knowing that nothing just 'happens' to me, and from knowing that I can affect any change of circumstance that I wish for my own life.  Also, The Secret led to my now strong spiritual faith - a knowing that this physical world with its miraculously precise laws is not an accident of evolution, and that there is much more to life, the world, and our place in it than our senses would have us believe.So, it was no surprise to me that I loved The Magic.  It was, though, a surprise to me that I loved it as MUCH as I did and do.  In fact, I can confidently say that The Magic is my favorite of Rhonda Byrne's books so far, and, I truly do think, her best book.  I also felt that The Power, her most recent book before The Magic, was better than The Secret, so in a way I feel that Rhonda's books are getting better and better.If you haven't read any of Rhonda Byrne's books, and are wondering whether you should just read The Magic, or all three of her books, I would describe them this way:  The Secret is the basic and fundamental work that explains the theory and philosophy of law of attraction, and how to apply it to each area of your life (relationships, health, money, work, etc).  If you don't know a lot or anything about law of attraction, I would read The Secret first.  If you are already familiar with the concept and application of law of attraction, you could easily jump to The Magic, or read both The Power and The Magic.  That said, it is obvious The Magic is written for all people, whether they have ever heard of the law of attraction or not.The Power takes the law of attraction to a much, much deeper level, and is a more 'spiritual' book than The Secret; it has less of a material world focus than The Secret (less about getting the house, car, job, etc. that you want, and more about love, happiness, and realizing the beauty and meaning of life), and encourages the reader to think beyond the physical world.The Magic is like the best of The Secret and The Power combined, AND it has something that neither of the other two books have - a day-by-day practical application of the knowledge.  There are 28 days of gratitude practices, and collectively they cover every area of your life, targeting the power of law of attraction through gratitude at your health and body (and your feelings about your body), your relationships, your job, your money, your daily life, and any problems or negative situations you might be facing.  With every passing day you will feel an ENORMOUS difference in your mood and emotions, you will see a big difference in how your days unfold (they seem so much easier, smoother, and more fun and joyful), and with your changing feelings and attitude you will see each of those areas of your life improving, flourishing, blossoming.There is no doubt that the practice of gratitude (what The Magic is all about) is the absolute fastest way to a magical, joyful life.  It's also, for me, the most natural and enjoyable way of making my life better!  I would much prefer to write a gratitude list than visualize something I want to happen.  Practicing gratitude just FEELS so good - and the more you do it, the more you want to do it!I definitely recommend this book.  It's another life-changer from Rhonda Byrne.

The feeling is the magic part Rhonda forgot, but it is in this book. One day Ester, the author of several books including: Ask and It Is Given: Learning to Manifest Your Desires (Law of Attraction Book 7) will publish the Secret behind the Secret :).In the book Rhonda Byrne talks very clearly about that gratitude is not about saying, "Thank you" for someone holding the door open for you...rather it's much more than that.. In addition, I would add the feeling experience to being grateful for everything you receive.The book is a very easy read, so I gave it 5 stars. It's a very good book and really explains how LOA work in easy terms. Do the work for 28 days straight and see your world transform!

I love all of Rhonda's work.  It's so easy to get caught up in the daily drama that can drag you away from positive thought and the simple secrets of creating the life you want.  This book reminds you and brings you back to the positive place of attraction.

In The Secret, Rhonda Byrne introduced the reader to the concept of The Law of Attraction. In her latest book, The Magic, she focuses on how gratitude can change our lives; that we will attract all we want when we practice feeling gratitude.The book begins with a reminder of how we felt magic in life as children; how as adults, we want to be around kids just to feel that magic again. She then explains how we can feel that magic again as adults...In the Gospel of Matthew in the Holy Scriptures, written over 2000 years ago, there is a cryptic message that has caused confusion...the crux of it is that "whoever has gratitude will be given more and he or she will have abundance."As in The Law of Attraction, "like attracts like." So, if you are grateful for what's in your life, the law of attraction will attract more of that into your life.Byrne writes that all the major religions have gratitude at their core...So The Magic is having gratitude in your life.Having gratitude takes practice, according to Byrne. She advises the reader to practice saying "thank you" and meaning it...that saying a heartfelt thank you will change your life:  Say thank you deliberately and with meaning  The more you say thank you, the more you feel gratitude  The more gratitude you give out, the more abundance you will receiveThe Magic is uplifting to read. Will it really completely change your life? It depends...working real gratitude into your life is a good thing. How much it'll change your world depends...I would add that I have a spiritual, not religious background, and gratitude is also central to spirituality. It just makes sense.As a Feng Shui interior designer who also practices the law of attraction, I would like to suggest some ways to help you be reminded to feel gratitude every day: surround yourself with things in your home that make you feel good and feel grateful to own...keep your home free from clutter, as clutter causes confusion and a muddled mind; place objects with the intent that they will help you attract what you desire. A book I recommend to all my clients that will help you do all of this is HARMONIOUS ENVIRONMENT:BEAUTIFY, DETOXIFY  ENERGIZE YOUR LIFE, YOUR HOME  YOUR PLANET. Trust me; it'll help you attract abundance in your life.Liked and recommend THE MAGIC....and THE SECRET if you haven't already read it.

I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!! I was given the digital version, but I wanted a copy that I could hold in my hands. I have given this book to at least 10 people. This book so impacted me, and I love the daily rituals. I still do the Magic Rock each night before BED, and I try to do my gratitude journal each night before I go to bed, too. (I'm not always successful in writing in my gratitude journal every night). I go to sleep uplifted and grateful and arise that way in the morning, too. Just imagine the power of being truly grateful. I've heard about gratitude changing things for so many years, but this book gives you practical ways to experience being grateful, and the MAGIC shows up. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! My coach first gave it to me, and it literally got me out of the morass  fear into possibility. More importantly, I stopped complaining  whining and feeling like a victim. Life had beaten me down, and I didn't know how to get back up. Stress  financial lack had taken over, and I was dealing with the after effects - not empowered, feeling sorry for myself and feeling like a failure. This book was MAGIC for me. I hope it will be for you, too.

Thank you so very much for asking. This book has change my life. I now have a different look on life and those around me. I always appreciated my family and friends. But now I am so very grateful for them. I am happier, each day I wake I am thankful that I am alive more than ever before. I should have known about this book sooner. However, I am grateful to have found at this time in my life.  I have given it to my children now because I want them to feel and know about this change in life. It's an awesome feeling. Thank you, Rhonda Byrne, for sharing your book with me. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

My favorite.  The books are easy to read and repetitive, but they should be.  This one is more of an action book in that it expects you to do things to improve your own life.  Imagine that!  And it works!!!
</review_text>

<review>
<review_text>
Amazing!!!  I'm on day 25 and I'm sad it's coming to an end.  I have been doing the book along with my Mom and we love it!  We are going to start it over at the end.  Such a feel good book that really helps you be more grateful which brings the MAGIC! I'm so glad I found this book.

I liked this book because it was not only informative but a step by step guide to achieving results.  It is broken down to daily exercises that can be done in a 5 to 10 minute period anytime throughout the day.  It is a great addition to the secret series.
</review_text>

I find this series very inspiring and helpful.  I try to read from the series daily to keep a positive outlook.  This book focuses on the power of gratitude.

Not that interesting to me I haven't even finish reading it but "I've read "The Secret" 3 times since I've had it and watched the movie twice.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
This book really helped me to see where I was going wrong with my life. I have seen an enormous change with the way I view things in my life. This book can truly help if you are having any kind of struggles in your life. This book totally changed me.
</review_text>
</review>

If you want to have a constructive perspective on life, do the practices in this book.  The expression of GRATITUDE will never fail the human spirit.

Amazing Book! Great wisdom. It helped me go through the toughest time in my life. I completed my 28 days and started all over again. It's true! The power of gratitude creates Magic! Thank you and God bless you!.

I'm in total love with this book. I just began reading it and its more of a guide for magic in your life within 30 days or so, but I'm on my 3rd day and i feel amazing and can see a difference can't wait to finish the book. But it's a daily read, guide on how to and you practice it every day. I purchased the journal also which worked out amazing since you have to write out 10 reasons why you are grateful each day for 30 days.  I love it.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
Such a fantastic book!  It's something you can read over and over again until it sinks in, but its not complicated or hard to understand.  It all makes perfect sense.. almost like those "why didnt I think of this before" moments..  I absolutely love this book!
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
If you loved the movie, THE SECRET, then you will definitely be thrilled with the book - THE MAGIC!  Here are a lot of the subjects covered in the movie, but now you have them in your hands and can go back to read/re-read whenever you want to.  There is a lot of amazing information that you can start incorporating into your life immediately - and the results can also be immediate as well.  I highly recommend this book (and refer to it on a daily basis myself!) to anyone ready to tap into the FULL potential that each of us has within us!

The author makes it very clear that we should all give thanks for what we have (Gratitude)  and for every thing for being able to get out of bed in the morning to being able to put your self to sleep at night and she lists everything in between. If you or you know someone on the edge that thinks they have nothing to be great full for this might be what you are looking for. It will send you in the right direction.

In the past others have suggested that I keep a gratitude journal, and sadly, every day I would struggle to think of 10 things for which to be grateful.  The Magic taught me different ways to express gratitude.  It expanded the areas in my life where I could find things for which to be grateful.  As I completed the month long gratitude program, I actually felt better.  Life seemed... brighter?  I can't say that all my wishes suddenly came true; a few small things did happen that made me go "hmmm."  More importantly the book reminded me how fortunate I am.  Gratitude is a state of mind, and this book shows you how to get there. This does reference law of attraction ideas, but honestly, if law of attraction is not your thing, you can still use this book to expand your thinking about gratitude.

This took me back to a traning i did about 20 years ago.Every one on this planet should do the magic and make our world a better place.I have been telling my friends about the Secret that could ghange there lives.The principle in the Secret is how we all should live.I remember a time when this was taught from childhood, some how it got lost because of the way society is driven. The moves, television. politics, Moden society have neglected the keys to life source that holes to life and why we are here.Thank You Miss RHonda Byrne

Rhonda Byrne have changed my life and I read and re-read them often to keep my life on track. The teachings of the Secret are real and have given me everything I have ever asked for. Believe in magic!! ❤

<review>
<review_text>
This book resonated with me even more than "The Secret."  It was quite eye opening to realize all the things around us for which to be grateful.  Living a life of gratitude has already made a difference in my life.  I highly recommend reading this book, and following the advice given.
</review_text>

Great book Taught me that being Thankful for everything and not negative. Will bring me greatness in life

I started reading the Magic when my baby sister and her husband introduced the book to me.  I was a little skeptical at first, but after reading the introduction to the book on line, I decided to give it a try.  I really have enjoyed this book, because it changes the way you think and the way you look at where you are in life.  The little exercises that you are given to do while reading the book are designed to help put that positive attitude of being grateful into action.  I would recommend this book to everyone who is trying to live life, and be thankful and grateful for what they have, knowing that being grateful for what we have opens the door for our increase.
</review_text>

I bought this book as a gift for my husband and I am very excited to read it after he does. He loves it so far!
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
I saw The Secret and then I came across The Magic and I knew I had to give it a try. The 28 days of Gratitude is absolutely AWESOME! It works! I even got my husband reading it now. I feel so much happier and at peace with myself and the world because of it! If you are considering purchasing this book DO IT! What have you got to lose? All the negativity in your life that's what! I gave this book 5 stars because I have seen the MAGIC work first hand!
</review_text>

<review>
<review_text>
This book changed my life. I am so grateful for each and every day of my life now. No more complaining or feeling sorry for myself.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
I was gifted this book and after reading through it, I was inspired to purchase copies for a few friends.Each day tackles an aspect of life and encourages you to shift your perspective and to focus on the positive.  Instead of being filled with other people's stories or chapters describing why you should make these changes, this book is filled with daily exercises.The exercises are easy to do and enable you to get into a more positive daily routine.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
Just beginning the process, but I read it through first. I admit I was skeptical about the book. But I am SO grateful that I read it. It brought me joy, for sure. It's not an easy feat to be critical of a book that encourages love and appreciation of all of our beautiful lives. This is a feel good book! There is joy to be had in this read. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I like the first half especially, as it reminds us of all the things in life to be grateful for and not take for granted. I got bogged down in the middle where she wants us to use magical thinking to get checks in the mail.I did love the being grateful for all the people who help us like busboys and gardeners. I remember to greet cleaners in buildings now, and they look surprised that someone actually sees them.Another good idea, not originally hers, but from  that great inspiring Earl Nightengale --  that nothing we do is accomplished or enjoyed or used without the help of countless unknown people who helped to make what we use, or eat, or wear every day. Thank them.

<review_text>
This book is an eye opener.  I never realized how much I thought negatively all my life.  This book will show you how "ungrateful" you have been in your life, and will turn you into a person who loves everything about life and make you grateful for all your blessings, even the little ones.  It does take some discipline to take the course, but it is well worth it.

Byrne has magically written an entire book about one if the first things our parents teach us to do as a child..."say thank you". I've read many self-help books and books in spirituality, because I enjoy the subjects, I derive peace of mind, and hopefully I'm a little better and more aware as a person when learning from each one.Magic brings mindfulness down to the simplest of levels to comprehend and apply. The author does a great job of bridging knowledge and application, giving the reader specific takeaways to practice and develop into positive habit.I am grateful for Ms Byrne and her gifts to the humankind.

great great great. get a journal to write the practices .... get your gratitude on and read this book. I cannot say enough of the magic it makes.

I am on day four and I am loving it.  This came highly recommended.  The language can be a little"hokey" for me sometimes, but the message is right on.  I look forward to each new daily practice.

This is just amazing, the structure and simplicity of it that enables massive change in every area of your life is simply incredible. I will read this book many times over!! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
There are a few good nuggets in the book, but overall it's overly simplistic in its approach. It preaches a ritual that is mechanical, and by the end of the first chapter, repetitious. The message becomes trite early in the book.I gave the book two stars instead of one only because the book does serve to reinforce the power of acknowledging the good things in one's life. But reading through the repetition can be saved by practicing this well known and simple concept: keep a positive mental attitude.
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
While I have read the whole 4 book series, my only complaint is this is NOT text to speech compatible.  To have to pay extra to have someone read it to me seems absurd, since the Kindle has a fully functioning ability to do that.  So, 4 out of 5.....
</review_text>
</review>
<review>
<review_text>
Way better than the secret, in my opinion.This focuses only on Gratitude and guides you through simple daily exercises that really adjust your attitude and thinking for the positive!

this is wonderful it is true about the gratitude it is magic and it changes your life

This is an excellent read - especially for anyone with doubts about their future - physically, mentally, economically or just life in general. This book encourages you to visit and experience the positive side of life with the magic of gratitiude that you can possess and trust me it spreads when you use it.....bless you Rhonda you have enlightened me for sure......THANK YOU

This book really has the power to change one's life, if the principles are applied.It creates an atmosphere for you that is far better than the one you now have. There are different chapters with things to do which will change your ways of thinking, and if followed, it will surely bring a great positive turnabout in your life.The chapters bring you wisdom, discipline, and the ability to be grateful for all that you now have. Following the practice which is not difficult will bring you into a happy, and orderly life.I have only read the first few chapters, and plan on continuing the practices given here. I think so much of the book, purchased at Amazon, that I plan on giving it away to my two daughters.Thank you for reading this.

If you allow these seeminly simple truths penetrate you, you may come to find that you are already blessed beyond measure, and that your awareness of your blessings just brings more.  Rhonda, thank you for your generosity is sharing these truths and presenting them in the most easily digestible way...I am eternally grateful!

The Magic is a workbook. I would describe it this way. You have 27 days of different positive activities to do. This helped a lot to teach you how to be thankful for the little things in life.I enjoyed this.The book is something to keep forever. You can re-read any part of it to help maintain your positive attitude.I have the Kindle edition from here but I also bought the book.

I haven't finished reading but what I have read is very inspirational and deep for thought.  There are concepts that really get your spirit inspired and strengthened.  Definitely a read that requires quiet time, without distractions.  Give yourself time to ponder and apply to your life.

Without a doubt, Rhonda Byrne has done it again!  Written a book which is one that all should read!  If one thinks it becomes repetative, its all with good reason.... If she said most of what she does just once, too many would NOT GET IT and then it wouldn't be the effective,  powerful,  life changing advice and information that these books are filled with.... They are the easiest of reads and no one should go without if you are not living the exact life that you want (and you deserve!!!).. its so easy to get to the life you have always wanted and dreamed of.... its really not HARD!!!  Just do it!  :)Great work again, Rhonda!!!  Where do  we go from here???

I highly recommend this book. Going thru the daily exercises have helped me focus on all the things that I have to be grateful for and I have alot.  I used to focus on the negative aspects of my life and this book has helped change that way of thinking.  As a result I have seen more and more positive things happening in my life!

I've been on my own spiritual journey the last few years, and I'm always looking for good reading material that touches my soul, and speaks directly to me.  This one hit the mark.  Each day it you have different exercises to help you cultivate your inner happiness and authentic self.  It helped me to look at the world, and people around me in a more positive view.  I'm already a positive person, it brought my awareness to a new level.  Forever Grateful!
